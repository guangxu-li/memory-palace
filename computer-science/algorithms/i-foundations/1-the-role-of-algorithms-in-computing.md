# 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## 1.1 Algorithms

_**What are algorithms?**_

Informally, an **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**.

An algorithm is thus **a sequence of computational steps** that **transform the input into the output**.

**How to formally define the** _**sorting problem:**_

**Input:** A sequence of $$n$$numbers $$<a_1,a_2,...,a_n>$$.

**Ouput:** A permutation \(reordering\) $$<a_{1}^{'},a_{2}^{'},...,a_{3}^{'}>$$ of the input sequence such that $$<a_{1}^{'}\leq a_{2}^{'}\leq \dots \leq a_{3}^{'}>$$.
