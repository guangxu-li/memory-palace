# 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## 1.1 Algorithms

_**What are algorithms?**_

Informally, an **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**.

An algorithm is thus **a sequence of computational steps** that **transform the input into the output**.
