# A 1192. Critical Connections in a Network

## Description

There are `n` servers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by undirected server-to-server `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between servers `a` and `b`. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A _critical connection_ is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5`
* `connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`
* There are no repeated connections.

## Approach: Tarjan Algorithm

### Intuition

The problem could use the method which is similar to \[\[Tarjan's Algorithm\]\].

### Algorithm

Pick and arbitrary vertex of the graph `root` and run \[\[depth first search\]\] from it. Note the following fact \(which is easy to prove\):

> Let's say we are in the DFS, looing through the edges starting from vertex `v`. The current edge `(v, u)` is a bridge if and only if none of the vertices `u` and its descendants in the DFS traversal tree has a back-edge to vertex `v` or any of its ancestors. Indeed, this condition means that there is no other way from `v` to `u` except for edge `(v, u)`.

Let `distance[v]` denote the entry time for node `v`. We introduce an array `origin` which will let us check the fact for each vertex `v`. `origin[v]` is the minimum of `distance[v]`, which means it's origin is `origin[v]`. The entry times `distance[p]` for each node `p` that is connected to node `v` via a back edge `(v, p)` and the values of `origin[u]` for each vertex `u` which is a direct descendant of `v` in the DFS tree:

$$
\operatorname{origin}[v]=\min \left\{\begin{array}{ll}\operatorname{distance}[v]\\ \operatorname{distaince}[p]  & \text { for all } p \text { for which }(v, p) \text { is a back edge } \\ \operatorname{origin}[u] & \text { for all } t o \text { for which }(v, u) \text { is a tree edge } \end{array}\right.
$$

    private int[] origin;
    private int timer = 0;

    private List<List<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();
    private List<List<Integer>> bridges = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();

        distance[v] = origin[v] = ++timer;

        for (int u : adj.get(v)) {
            if (u == prev) {
                continue;
            }

            if (distance[u] > 0) {
                origin[v] = Math.min(origin[v], distance[u]);
            } else {
                dfs(u, v);
                origin[v] = Math.min(origin[v], origin[u]);

                if (origin[u] > distance[v]) {
                    bridges.add(Arrays.asList(u, v));
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private void formAdjacency(List<List<Integer>> connections) {
        for (List<Integer> connection : connections) {
            int v = connection.get(0);
            int u = connection.get(1);

            adj.get(v).add(u);
            adj.get(u).add(v);
        }
    }

    public List<List<Integer>> criticalConnections(int n, List<List<Integer>> connections) {
        distance = new int[n];
        origin = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }

        formAdjacency(connections);

        while (--n >= 0) {
            if (distance[n] == 0) {
                dfs(n, 0);
            }
        }

        return bridges;
    }
