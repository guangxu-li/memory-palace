# Convert Sorted List to Binary Search

## Description

Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**

```text
Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

## Intuition

The problem is same as [[problem 108]] except for the list. But the list is still sorted. So the
problem doesn't change.

Except the two approaches in problem 108, the approach by simulating inorder traversal is also work.

The idea is that inorder traversal generates sorted array. So we can use the generate the tree by
using the value order in list.

## Approach: Inorder Traversal

### Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    private ListNode head;

    private TreeNode convertSortedListToBST(int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) {
            return null;
        }

        int mid = (start + end) / 2;

        TreeNode left = convertSortedListToBST(start, mid - 1);

        TreeNode node = new TreeNode(head.val);

        head = head.next;
        node.left = left;

        node.right = convertSortedListToBST(mid + 1, end);

        return node;
    }

    private int getListSize(ListNode head) {
        int size = 0;

        while (head != null) {
            size++;
            head = head.next;
        }

        return size;
    }

    public TreeNode sortedListToBST(ListNode head) {
        this.head = head;

        int size = getListSize(head);

        return convertSortedListToBST(0, size - 1);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time complexity:** $$O(N)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(\log(N))$$. We are building a height-balanced BST, so the height is
  bounded by $$O(\log(N))$$.
