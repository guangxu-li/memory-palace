# B 142. Linked List Cycle II

## Description

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position \(0-indexed\) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Note:** Do not modify the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Can you solve it without using extra space?

## Approach: Floyd's Tortoise and Hare

### Intuition

What happens when a fast funner  \(a hare\) races a slow runner \(a tortoise\) on a circular track? At some point, the fast runner will catch up to the slow runner from behind.

### Algorithm

Floyd's algorithm is separated into two distinct _phases_. In the first phase, it determines whether a cycle is present in the list. If no cycle is present, it returns `null` immediately, as it is impossible to find the entrance to a nonexistant cycle. Otherwise, it uses the located "intersection node" to find the entrance to the cycle.

_Phase 1_

Here, we initialize two pointers - fast `hare` and the slow `tortoise`. Then, until `hare` can no longer advance, we increment `tortoise` once and `hare` twice. If, after advancing them, `hare` and `tortoise` point to the same node, we return it. Otherwise, we continue. If the loop terminates without returning a node, then the list is acyclic, and we return `null` to indicate as much.

Consider the images below:

_Phase 2_

To prove this is correct, consider the image below:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28171%29.png)

$$
\begin{aligned} 2 \cdot \text {distance}(\text {tortoise}) &=\operatorname{distance}(\text {hare}) \\ 2(F+a) &=F+a+b+a \\ 2 F+2 a &=F+2 a+b \\ F &=b \end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, pointers starting at nodes $$h$$ and $$0$$ wil traverse the same number of nodes before meeting.
