# B 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

\(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`\).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

## Approach: Binary Search

**Algorithm**

1. Find the `mid` element of the array.
2. If `mid element >= first element of array` this means that we need to look for the inflection point on the right of `mid` .
3. If `mid element < first element of array` this means that we need to look for the inflection point on the left of `mid` .
4. In the end, the target value will lay on the index `lo`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = nums.length - 1;

        if (nums[hi] >= nums[0]) {
            return nums[0];
        }

        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = (hi + lo) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] >= nums[0]) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return nums[lo];
    }

```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** Same as Binary Search $$O(\log ‚Å° N)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$
