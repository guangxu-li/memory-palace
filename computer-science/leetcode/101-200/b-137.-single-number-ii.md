# B 137. Single Number II

## Description

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears _three_ times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

## Approach 1: Math

$$
3 * (a + b + c) - (a + a + a + b + b + b + c + c) = c
$$

## Approach 2: Bit Manipulation

### Algorithm

$$
a \oplus 0 = a \\ a \oplus a = 0
$$

So for number $$a$$, the first time and third time result are both $$a$$. That means we can't distinguish between these two situation according to the value.

To seperate number that appears once from a number that appears three times, lets use two bitmasks instead of one.

The idea is to:

* change the first bitmask only if the second bit mask is unchanged
* change the second bitmask only if the first bit mask is unchanged

### Implementation

{% tab title="Java" %}
```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            x = ~y & (x ^ num);
            y = ~x & (y ^ num);
        }

        return y;
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

* **Time complexity:** $$O(N)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$.
