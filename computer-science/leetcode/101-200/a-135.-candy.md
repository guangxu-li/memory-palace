# A 135. Candy

## Description

There are _N_ children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

* Each child must have at least one candy.
* Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

## Approach 1: Two Pass

### Algorithm

The number of candies that a child can get is determined by the child's neighbors' rating. So we scan from left to right and from right to left. The maximum of these two scanning result is the answer that satisfies in both directions.

```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        if (ratings.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int[] candies = new int[ratings.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < ratings.length; i++) {
            if (i != 0 && ratings[i - 1] < ratings[i]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                candies[i] = 1;
            }
        }

        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = ratings.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (i != ratings.length - 1 && ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
            }
            sum += candies[i];
        }

        return sum;
    }

## Approach 2: One Pass

### Algorithm

`Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, ,2, 1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, ,3, 2, 1, 1, 3, ,3 ,3 ,4, 2]`

For the uphill, the number of candies is starting from $$1$$ to $$n$$. For the downhill, the number of candies is starting from $$n$$ to $$1$$.

For the downhill, we need to find the "size" of the slope to know how many candies for the child among children on the slope that has the highest rating. However, we could simply do the same thing as the uphill. Instead of adding from $$n$$ to $$1$$, we could do it from $$1$$ to $$n$$.

{% hint style="info" %}
On the downhill phase, if $$n$$ is large than the previous "peak", then we need to increase the peak.

        int cur = 1;
        int sum = 1;
        int dir = 0;
        long peak = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1; i < ratings.length; i++) {
            if (ratings[i - 1] < ratings[i]) {
                if (dir == -1) {
                    cur = 1;
                }

                cur++;
                dir = 1;
            } else if (ratings[i - 1] == ratings[i]) {

                    cur = 0;
                }

                if (++cur == peak) {
                    peak++;
                    sum++;
                }

                dir = -1;
            }

            sum += cur;
        }

        return sum;
