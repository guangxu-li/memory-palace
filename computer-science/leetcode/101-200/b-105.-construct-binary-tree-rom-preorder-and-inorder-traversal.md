# B 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

## Description

Given \[\[preorder\]\] and \[\[inorder\]\] traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note:** You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

```text
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```

return the following binary tree:

```text
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

## Approach 1: Recursive

### Algorithm

One of characteristics of inorder traversal is that if we know the root in the array. We're sure that all elements before the root is root's left subtree and the others compose the right subtree.

Using this characteristics, we can divide the problem into overlap subproblem. For each level of recursion, we find the root first according to the preorder traversal in which root always goes first. Then the remaining problem is to find the root of its left subtree and the right subtree.

### Implementation

```java
class solution {
    private int[] preorder;
    private int[] inorder;

    private int preindex = 0;

    private map<integer, integer> map = new hashmap<>();

    public treenode buildtree(int[] preorder, int[] inorder) {
        this.preorder = preorder;
        this.inorder = inorder;

        for (int i = 0; i < inorder.length; i++) {
            map.put(inorder[i], i);
        }

        return buildtreenode(0, inorder.length - 1);
    }

    private treenode buildtreenode(int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) {
            return null;
        }

        treenode node = new treenode(preorder[preindex++]);

        int inindex = map.get(node.val);

        node.left = buildtreenode(start, inindex - 1);
        node.right = buildtreenode(inindex + 1, end);

        return node;
    }
}
```

> To reduce the time complexity of search `root` index in `inorder` array, we used hash map.

### Complexity analysis

* **Time complexity:** $$o(n)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$o(n)$$. For the recursion depth, the best case is $$o(\log(n))$$ and the

  worst case is $$o(n)$$. However, there are $$o(n)$$ operations to build the hash map. In total,

  it's $$o(n)$$.

## Approach 2: Iterative

### Algorithm

Since preorder is done by doing \[\[DFS\]\] and there is a way to use iterations to solve DFS, it's possible to solve this iteratively.

We go as deep as we can and stop when we find that the node is showing at the `inorder[inindex]`. that means for the current node, we have reached the max depth. we need to change the path. Now the problem is how to find the correct "turning point".

Let's go back to the inorder traversal and preorder traversal again.

1. In preorder traversal array, root always comes up eariler than left child and right child.
2. In inorder traversal array, root divides the array into two subtrees of it.

So in inorder traversal, if two elements like a and b are adjacent, there are two possibilities.

1. The first one \(a\) is the root and the other one \(b\) is the right child.
2. The second one \(b\) is the root and the other one \(a\) is the left child.

And from the view of preorder traversal, these two possiblities are like:

1. $$[..., a, b,...]$$
2. $$[..., b, a, ...]$$

Back to the question of how to find the correct "turning point". Let's assume that it is when we encounter "a" that we need to consider this question. If we find the pattern "ba" in preorder traversal and the pattern "ab" in inorder pattern, these nodes have been inserted. So the correct point is the last match point.

**For example:**

> Preorder: \[1, 4, 10, ...\] 
>
> Inorder:    \[10, 4, 2, ...\]
>
> \[..., 4, 10, ...\] match \[10, 4, ...\], then the correct position where the next node should inserted to is "4".

### Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode buildTree(int[] preorder, int[] inorder) {
        Deque<TreeNode> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode();
        stack.push(root);

        int inIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < preorder.length; i++) {
            TreeNode node = new TreeNode(preorder[i]); // The node that is going to be inserted
            TreeNode position = stack.peek();  // It denotes where to insert the node 

            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek().val == inorder[inIndex]) {
                position = stack.pop();
                inIndex++;
            }

            if (position == stack.peek()) {
                position.left = node;
            } else {
                position.right = node;
            }

            stack.push(node);
        }

        return root.left;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time complexity:** $$O(N)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(\log(N))$$ for the best case and $$O(N)$$ for the worst case.
