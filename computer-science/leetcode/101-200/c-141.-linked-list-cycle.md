# C 141. Linked List Cycle

## Description

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position \(0-indexed\) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

Can you solve it using _O\(1\)_ \(i.e. constant\) memory?

## Approach: Slow and Fast Pointers

### Intuition

If there's a cycle in the list, then the fast pointer will eventually catch up with the slow pointer.

### Implementation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java" %}
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return false;
        }

        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head.next;

        while (slow != fast) {
            if (fast == null || fast.next == null) {
                return false;
            }

            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time complexity:** $$O(N)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$.
