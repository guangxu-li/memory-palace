# C 176. Second Highest Salary

## Description

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```text
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return `200` as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

```text
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

## Approach: Using sub-query

```sql
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
```
