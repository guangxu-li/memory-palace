# \*B 127. Word Ladder

## Description

Given two words \(_beginWord_ and _endWord_\), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from _beginWord_ to _endWord_, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list.

**Note:**

* Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume _beginWord_ and _endWord_ are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

## Approach: Bidirectional BFS

### Intuition

The graph formed from the nodes in the dictionary might be too big. The search space considered by the breadth first search algorithm depends upon the branching factor of the nodes at each level. If the branching factor remains the same for all the nodes, the search space increases exponentially along with the number of levels. Consider a simple example of a binary tree. With each passing level in a complete binary tree, the number of nodes increase in powers of **2**.

We can considerably cut down the search space of the standard breadth first search algorithm if we launch two simultaneous BFS. One from the `beginWord` and the other one from the `endWord` . We progress one node at a time from both sides and at any point in time if we find a common node in both the searches, we stop the search. This is known as **bidirectional BFS** and it considerably cuts down on the search space and hence reduces the time and space complexity.

### Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    private Set<String> wordSet;
    private int level = 0;

    private void buildConnections(Set<String> begin, Set<String> end) {
        level++;
        if (begin.isEmpty()) {
            level = 0;
            return;
        }

        wordSet.removeAll(begin);
        Set<String> nextLevel = new HashSet<>();

        for (String word : begin) {
            char[] wordChars = word.toCharArray();
            for (int i = 0; i < wordChars.length; i++) {
                char prev = wordChars[i];

                for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
                    if (c == prev) {
                        continue;
                    }

                    wordChars[i] = c;
                    String linkedWord = String.valueOf(wordChars);

                    if (wordSet.contains(linkedWord)) {
                        if (end.contains(linkedWord)) {
                            return;
                        } else {
                            nextLevel.add(linkedWord);
                        }
                    }
                }

                wordChars[i] = prev;
            }
        }

        if (nextLevel.size() > end.size()) {
            buildConnections(end, nextLevel);
        } else {
            buildConnections(nextLevel, end);
        }
    }

    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        wordSet = new HashSet<>(wordList);

        if (!wordSet.contains(endWord)) {
            return level;
        }

        Set<String> begin = new HashSet<>();
        begin.add(beginWord);
        Set<String> end = new HashSet<>();
        end.add(endWord);

        level++;
        buildConnections(begin, end);

        return level;
    }
}
```
