# \*B 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence

## Description

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

**Example 1:**  
Input: 

```text
"bbbab"
```

Output: 

```text
4
```

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

**Example 2:**  
Input:

```text
"cbbd"
```

Output:

```text
2
```

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
