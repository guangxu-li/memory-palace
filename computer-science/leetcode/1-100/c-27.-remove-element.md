# C 27. Remove Element

## Description

Given an array _nums_ and a value _val_, remove all instances of that value [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O\(1\) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example 1:**

```text
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```text
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

## Approach 1: Two Pointers

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[start] = nums[i];
                start++;
            }
        }

        return start;
    }
}
```

**Complexity analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$. Assume the array has a total of $$n$$ elements, both `start` and `i` traverse at most $$n$$ steps.
* **Space complexit:** $$O(1)$$. 

## Approach 2: Two Pointers - when elements to remove are rare

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int len = nums.length;

        int i = 0;
        while (i < len) {
            if (nums[i] == val) {
                nums[i] = nums[len - 1];

                len--;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }

        return len;
    }
}
```

**Complexity analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$. Both `i` and `len` traverse at most nn steps. In this approach, the number of assignment operations is equal to the number of elements to remove. So it is more efficient if elements to remove are rare.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$.
