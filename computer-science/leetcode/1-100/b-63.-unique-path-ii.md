# B 63. Unique Path II

## Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid \(marked 'Start' in the diagram below\).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid \(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below\).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Approach: Dynamic Programming

_Refer to_ [_Problem 62_](b-62.-unique-paths.md#approach-2-dynamic-programming)\_\_

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int n = obstacleGrid.length;
        int m = obstacleGrid[0].length;

        for (int row = n - 1; row >= 0; row--) {
            for (int col = m - 1; col >= 0; col--) {
                if (row == n - 1 && col == m - 1) {
                    obstacleGrid[row][col] ^= 1;
                } else if (obstacleGrid[row][col] == 1) {
                    obstacleGrid[row][col] = 0;
                } else if (row == n - 1) {
                    obstacleGrid[row][col] += obstacleGrid[row][col + 1];
                } else if (col == m - 1) {
                    obstacleGrid[row][col] += obstacleGrid[row + 1][col];
                } else {
                    obstacleGrid[row][col] += obstacleGrid[row][col] == 1 ? 0
                            : obstacleGrid[row + 1][col] + obstacleGrid[row][col + 1];
                }
            }
        }

        return obstacleGrid[0][0];
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(M\cdot N)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$.
