# A 99. Recover Binary Search  Tree

## Description

Two elements of a binary search tree \(BST\) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,3,null,null,2]

   1
  /
 3
  \
   2

Output: [3,1,null,null,2]

   3
  /
 1
  \
   2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]

  3
 / \
1   4
   /
  2

Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]

  2
 / \
1   4
   /
  3
```

**Follow up:**

* A solution using O\(_n_\) space is pretty straight forward.
* Could you devise a constant space solution?

## Intuition

The problem can be divided to two problems:

1. Inorder traversal the tree.
2. Find the two swapped `TreeNode` .

### Inorder traversal

There're three ways to code the inorder traversal:

1. Iteration
2. Recursive
3. Morris Inorder Traversal

### Find two swapped TreeNode

During the inorder traversal of the binary search tree, it like scanning a sorted array. Then we could get the two swapped treenode by comaring `prev.val` and `curr.val` .

```java
if prev.val > curr.val
    y = curr
    if (x == null)
        x = prev
```
