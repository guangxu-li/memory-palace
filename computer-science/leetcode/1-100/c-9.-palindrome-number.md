# C 9. Palindrome Number

## Description

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 121
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Follow up:**

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Approach: Revert Half of the Number

When the original number is less than the reversed number, it means we've processed half of the number digits.

**Special cases:**

1. `x < 0 -> false`
2. `the last digit of x is 0 , if x != 0 -> false, else true`
{% endhint %}

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0) && x != 0) {
            return false;
        }

        int rev = 0;
        while (x > rev) {
            rev = 10 * rev + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }

        return rev == x || rev / 10 == x;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(\log_{10} n)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$.
