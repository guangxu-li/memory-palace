# C 38. Count and Say

## Description

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```text
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.  
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.  
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".
```

## Approach 1: Sliding Windows

**Intuition & Algorithm**

```java
class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        String ans = "1";

        while (n > 1) {
            int i = 0;
            String prev = new String(ans);
            ans = new String();

            while (i < prev.length()) {

                int j = i + 1;
                while (j < prev.length()) {
                    if (prev.charAt(i) == prev.charAt(j)) {
                        j++;
                    } else {
                        break;
                    }

                }

                ans += Integer.toString(j - i) + prev.charAt(i);

                i = j;
            }

            n--;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis

* **Time complexity:** $$O(2^n)$$. It's hard to determine the time complexity for average cases, but we could determine that of the worst case. In the worst case, every character is different to its adjacent one. In this case, the size of the new sequence will be double of the old one's.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(2^{n-1})$$

## Approach 2: Regular Expression

**Intuition & Algorithm**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2853%29.png)

```java
class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        String ans = "1";

        String regex = "(.)\\1*";
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);

        while (n > 1) {
            String prev = new String(ans);
            ans = new String();

            Matcher m = pattern.matcher(prev);

            while (m.find()) {
                ans += Integer.toString(m.group().length()) + m.group().charAt(0);
            }

            n--;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis

_Similar to approach 1_

* **Time complexity:** $$O(2^n)$$. 
* **Space complexity:** $$O(2^{n-1})$$
