# B 16. 3Sum Closest

## Description

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example:**

```text
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

## Approach 1: Two Pointers

The two pointers pattern requires the array to be sorted. As our **BCR** is $$O(n^2)$$, the sort operation would not change the overall time complexity.

We will follow the same [_two pointers approach as for 3Sum_](3sum.md#approach-1-two-pointers), however, since the "ideal" pair may not exist, we will track the smallest absolute different between the sum and the target.

```java
class Solution {
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        int diff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2 && diff != 0; i++) {
            int lo = i + 1;
            int hi = nums.length - 1;

            while (lo < hi) {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[lo] + nums[hi];

                if (Math.abs(sum - target) < Math.abs(diff)) {
                    diff = sum - target;
                }

                if (sum < target) {
                    lo++;
                } else if (sum == target) {
                    break;
                } else {
                    hi--;
                }
            }
        }

        return diff + target;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(n^2)$$. Sorting the array takes $$O(n\log{n})$$, so overall complexity is $$O(n\log{n} + n^2)$$. This is asymptotically equivalent to $$O(n^2)$$.
* **Space complexity:** from $$O(\log{n})$$ to $$O(n)$$, depending on the implementation of the sorting algorithm.

## Approach 2: Binary Search

In the two pointers approach, we fix one number and use two pointers to enumerate pairs. Here, we fix two numbers, and use a binary search to find the third complement number.

```java
class Solution {
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        int diff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2 && diff != 0; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length - 1; j++) {
                int lo = j + 1;
                int hi = nums.length - 1;

                while (lo <= hi) {
                    int mid = (lo + hi) >> 1;
                    int sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[mid];

                    if (Math.abs(sum - target) < Math.abs(diff)) {
                        diff = sum - target;
                    }

                    if (sum < target) {
                        lo = mid + 1;
                    } else if (sum == target) {
                        break;
                    } else {
                        hi = mid - 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return diff + target;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(n^2\log{n})$$. Binary search takes $$(n\log{n})$$, and we do it $$n$$ times.
* **Space complexity:** from $$O(\log{n})$$ to $$O(n)$$, depending on the implementation of the sorting algorithm.
