# B 36. Valid Sudoku

## Description

Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character `'.'`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being 
    modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

**Note:**

* A Sudoku board \(partially filled\) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
* Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
* The given board contain only digits `1-9` and the character `'.'`.
* The given board size is always `9x9`.

## Approach: Iteration

**Intuition & Algorithm**

According to the validation rules, we could maintain three kind of arrays. Each time we get a number, check if it's already in any of the three arrays. If it is, then the sudoku is not valid. Otherwise, put the number into these three arrays;

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {

        int[][][] validBlock = new int[3][3][9];

        int[][] validCol = new int[9][9];
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            char[] row = board[i];

            int[] validRow = new int[9];
            for (int j = 0; j < row.length; j++) {
                if (Character.isDigit(row[j])) {
                    int index = Character.getNumericValue(row[j]) - 1;
                    if (validRow[index]++ != 0 || validCol[j][index]++ != 0 || validBlock[i / 3][j / 3][index]++ != 0) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis

* **Time complexity:** $$O(1)$$. The size of input is constant.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$. The total size of arrays is constant.
