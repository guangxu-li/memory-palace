# A 72. Edit Distance

## Description

Given two words _word1_ and _word2_, find the minimum number of operations required to convert _word1_ to _word2_.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

## Approach: Dynamic Programming

```java
for each char in word1
    for each char in word2
        if word1.char == word2.char
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
        else
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        char[] word1Chars = word1.toCharArray();
        char[] word2Chars = word2.toCharArray();

        int[] dp = new int[word2.length() + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i <= word1Chars.length; i++) {
            int prev = dp[0];
            for (int j = 0; j <= word2Chars.length; j++) {
                int curr = dp[j];

                if (i == 0) {
                    dp[j] = j;
                } else if (j == 0) {
                    dp[j] = i;
                } else if (word1Chars[i - 1] != word2Chars[j - 1]) {
                    dp[j] = 1 + Math.min(prev, Math.min(dp[j], dp[j - 1]));
                } else {
                    dp[j] = prev;
                }

                prev = curr;
            }
        }

        return dp[word2.length()];
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(m,n)$$ where $$m$$ is the length of word1 and $$n$$ is the length of word2.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(n)$$.
