# A 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words

## Description

You are given a string, **s**, and a list of words, **words**, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring\(s\) in **s** that is a concatenation of each word in **words** exactly once and without any intervening characters.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
```

## Approach: Slide Window

Because every word in the words list has the same length. We can maintain multiple sliding windows and go through String s only once. The number of the windows needed is the length of the word.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findSubstring(String s, String[] words) {
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        if (words.length == 0 || s.length() < words[0].length() * words.length) {
            return ans;
        }

        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (String word : words) {
            map.put(word, map.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }

        int wordLen = words[0].length();
        int window = wordLen * words.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < wordLen; i++) {
            int start = i;

            while (start + window <= s.length()) {
                String str = s.substring(start, start + window);

                Map<String, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();

                int j = 0;
                for (j = words.length; j > 0; j--) {
                    String word = str.substring(wordLen * (j - 1), wordLen * j);

                    int count = seen.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1;

                    if (count > map.getOrDefault(word, 0)) {
                        break;
                    }

                    seen.put(word, count);
                }

                if (j == 0) {
                    ans.add(start);
                }

                start += wordLen * Math.max(j, 1);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(MN)$$, where $$M$$ is the size of single word and $$N$$ is the size of string.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(M(N + L))$$.
