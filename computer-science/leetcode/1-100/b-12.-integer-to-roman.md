# B 12. Integer to Roman

## Description

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```text
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X`+ `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` \(5\) and `X` \(10\) to make 4 and 9. 
* `X` can be placed before `L` \(50\) and `C` \(100\) to make 40 and 90. 
* `C` can be placed before `D` \(500\) and `M` \(1000\) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 3
Output: "III"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: "IV"
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: 9
Output: "IX"
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```text
Input: 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

## Approach 1: Greedy

So to represent a given integer, we look for the _**largest**_ **symbol** that fits into it. We subtract that, and then look for the largest symbol that fits into the remainder, and so on until the remainder is 0. Each of the symbols we take out are appended onto the output Roman Numeral string.

```java
class Solution {
    int[] values = { 1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1 };
    String[] symbols = new String[] { "M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I" };

    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < values.length && num > 0; i++) {
            while (values[i] <= num) {
                num -= values[i];
                ans.append(symbols[i]);
            }
        }

        return ans.toString();
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(1)$$. As there is a finite set of roman numerals, there is a hard upper limit on how many times the loop can iterate. This upper limit is `15` times, and it occurs for the number `3888` which has a representation of `MMMDCCCLXXXVIII`. Therefore, we say the time complexity is constant.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$. The amount of memory used doesn't not change with the size of the input integer, and is therefore constant.

## Approach 2: Hardcode Digits

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2823%29.png)

```java
class Solution {
    public String intToRoman(int num) {

        String[] thousands = { "", "M", "MM", "MMM" };
        String[] hundreds = { "", "C", "CC", "CCC", "CD", "D", "DC", "DCC", "DCCC", "CM" };
        String[] tens = { "", "X", "XX", "XXX", "XL", "L", "LX", "LXX", "LXXX", "XC" };
        String[] ones = { "", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII", "VIII", "IX" };

        return thousands[num / 1000] + hundreds[num % 1000 / 100] + tens[num % 100 / 10] + ones[num % 10];
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(1)$$. The same number of operations is done, regardless of the size of the input. Therefore, the time complexity is constant.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$. While we have Arrays, they are the same size, _regardless of the size of the input_. Therefore, they are constant for the purpose of space-complexity analysis.
