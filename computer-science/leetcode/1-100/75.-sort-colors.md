# B 75. Sort Colors

## Description

Given an array with _n_ objects colored red, white or blue, sort them [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) ****so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

* A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort. First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
* Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

## Approach: One Pass

**Intuition & Algorithm**

The problem is known as [Dutch National Flag Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem) and first was proposed by [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra).

```text
SORTCOLORS(nums)
    p0 <- 0
    p2 <- n - 1
    curr <- 0
    
    while current <= p2 do
        if nums[curr] = 0, then
            nums[p0] <-> nums[curr]
            move p0, curr forward
        else if nums[curr] = 1, then
            move curr forward
        else
            nums[p1] <-> nums[curr]
            move p2 backward
```



```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = nums.length - 1;

        int i = 0;

        while (i <= hi) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                nums[i++] = nums[lo];
                nums[lo++] = 0;
            } else if (nums[i] == 2) {
                nums[i] = nums[hi];
                nums[hi--] = 2;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
In the code line 13, there's a chance that `nums[hi] == 0` , Thus we don't increase i, so we can check it in the next iteration.
{% endhint %}

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$
