# B 60. Permutation Sequence

## Description

The set `[1,2,3,...,`_`n`_`]` contains a total of _n_! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for _n_ = 3:

1. `"123"`
2. `"132"`
3. `"213"`
4. `"231"`
5. `"312"`
6. `"321"`

Given _n_ and _k_, return the _k_th permutation sequence.

**Note:**

* Given _n_ will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
* Given _k_ will be between 1 and _n_! inclusive.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```

## Approach 1: Backtracking

Each `backtrack` deals with one position in the permutation, and continue to next position with candidates which not includes any number has been placed in the permutaion.

```java
class Solution {
    private char[] ans;

    private int count;
    private int size;
    private boolean flag = false; /* if we have found the k-th sequence */

    public String getPermutation(int n, int k) {
        ans = new char[n];
        count = k;
        size = n;

        char[] candidates = new char[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            candidates[i] = (char) ('0' + i + 1);
        }

        backtrack(candidates, 0);

        return String.valueOf(ans);
    }

    private void backtrack(char[] candidates, int pos) {
        if (pos == size) {
            count--;

            if (count == 0) {
                flag = true;
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i < candidates.length; i++) {
                if (candidates[i] != '.') {
                    ans[pos] = candidates[i];
                    candidates[i] = '.';

                    backtrack(candidates, pos + 1);

                    candidates[i] = ans[pos];
                }

                if (flag) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(N!)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(N)$$. The recursion depth and the size of `candidates` is `n` .

## Approach 2: Factorial Number System

### Factorial number system

Usually standard decimal or binary positional system could meet our needs. For example, each subset could be described by a number in binary representation

$$
k=\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} k_{m} 2^{m}, \quad 0 \leq k_{m} \leq 1
$$

Here is how it works:

The problem with permutations is that there is a much more permutations than subsets, $$N!$$ grows up much faster than $$2^N$$. Therefore, the solution space provided by the positional system with constant base cannot match with the number of permutations.

To solved this, the factorial number system is introduced. It's a positional system with **non-constant** base $$m!$$.

$$
k=\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} k_{m} m !, \quad 0 \leq k_{m} \leq m
$$

### Construct the permutation

For example, given N = 3 and k = 3. We first get the factorial reprensentation which is $$(1,0,0)$$.

{% hint style="success" %}
$$3 = 1 * 2! + 0 * 1! + 0 * 0!$$ 
{% endhint %}

Scan the factorial from the left to right and treat the number as index of the remaining candidates.

### Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public String getPermutation(int n, int k) {
        int[] factorial = new int[n];
        List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>();

        factorial[0] = 1;
        nums.add(1);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            factorial[i] = i * factorial[i - 1];
            nums.add(i + 1);
        }

        k--;
        StringBuilder permutation = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int idx = k / factorial[i];
            k -= idx * factorial[i];

            permutation.append(nums.get(idx));
            nums.remove(idx);
        }

        return permutation.toString();
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(N^2)$$. To delete elements from the list in a loop, it taks $$O(N)$$ and there are $$N$$ loops.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(N)$$.
