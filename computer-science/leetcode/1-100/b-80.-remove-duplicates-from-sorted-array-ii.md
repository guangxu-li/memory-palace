# B 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

## Description

Given a sorted array _nums_, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that duplicates appeared at most _twice_ and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O\(1\) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```text
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```text
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

## Approach: Two Pointers

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28118%29.png)

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int curr = 0;
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = 0;

        while (hi < nums.length) {
            if (curr != nums[hi]) {
                count = 1;
                curr = nums[hi];
                nums[lo++] = nums[hi++];
            } else if (count < 2) {
                count++;
                nums[lo++] = nums[hi++];
            } else {
                while (hi < nums.length && nums[hi] == curr) {
                    hi++;
                }
            }
        }

        return lo;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(N)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$.
