# B 96. Unique Binary Search Trees

## Description

Given _n_, how many structurally unique **BST's** \(binary search trees\) that store values 1 ... _n_?

**Example:**

```text
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

## Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

**Algorithm**

The problem is to calculate the number of unique BST. To do so, we can define two functions:

1. $$G(n)$$: the number of unique BST for a sequence of length `n` .
2. $$F(i, n)$$: the number of unique BST, where the number `i` is served as the root of BST $$(1 \leq i\leq n)$$.

$$G(N)$$ is the sum of BST $$F(i, n)$$ enumerating each num `i` as a root.

$$
G(n)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} F(i, n)
$$

And the base cases:

$$
G(0) = 1 \\ G(1) = 1
$$

Given a sequence `1 ... n` , we pick a number `i` out of the sequence as the root, then the number of unique BST with the specified root defined as $$F(i, n)$$, is the **cartesian product** of the number BST for its left and right subtrees, as illustrated below:

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, $$F(3, 7)$$, the number of unique BST tree with the number `3` as its root. We need to construct unique BST for a sequence of length 2 as the left subtree. Similarly, the right subtree with 4 nodes.
{% endhint %}

From the example, we could derive the followiong formula:

$$F(i, n) = G(i - 1)\cdot G(n- i)$$.

Review the define of $$G(n)$$, we can obtain a recursive formula for $$G(n)$$:

$$
G(n) = \sum_{i = 1} ^n G(i-1)\cdot G(n-i)
$$

To calculate the result of function, we start with the lower number, since the value of $$G(n)$$ depends on the values of $$G(0) \dots G(n - 1)$$.

**Implementation**

_Top Down_

```java
class Solution {
    private int[][] cache;

    public int numTrees(int n) {
        cache = new int[n + 1][n + 1];
        return numSubtrees(1, n);
    }

    private int numSubtrees(int lo, int hi) {

        if (cache[lo - 1][hi] != 0) {
            return cache[lo - 1][hi];
        }

        int count = 0;
        if (lo > hi) {
            count = 1;
        } else {
            for (int i = lo; i <= hi; i++) {
                int left = numSubtrees(lo, i - 1);
                int right = numSubtrees(i + 1, hi);

                count += left * right;
            }
        }

        cache[lo - 1][hi] = count;
        return count;
    }
}
```

_Bottom Up_

```java
class Solution {
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        int[] G = new int[n + 1];
        G[0] = 1;

        for (int N = 1; N <= n; N++) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
                G[N] += G[i - 1] * G[N - i];
            }
        }

        return G[n];
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* **Time complexity:** $$O(n^2)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(n)$$.

## Approach 2: Mathematical Deduction

**Intuition**

Actually, as it turns out, the sequence of $$G(n)$$ function results is known as _**Catalan Number**_ ****$$C_n$$.

$$
C_{0}=1, \quad C_{n+1}=\frac{2(2 n+1)}{n+2} C_{n}
$$
