# A 37.Sudoku Solver

## Description

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.

Empty cells are indicated by the character `'.'`.

A sudoku puzzle...

...and its solution numbers marked in red.

**Note:**

* The given board contain only digits `1-9` and the character `'.'`.
* You may assume that the given Sudoku puzzle will have a single unique solution.
* The given board size is always `9x9`.

## Approach 0: Brute Force

The first idea is to use brute force to generate all possible ways to fill the cells with numbers from `1` to `9` , and then check them to keep the solution only. That means $$9^{81}$$ operations to do. Hence we have to think further how to optimize.

## Approach 1: Backtracking

**Intuition & Algorithm**

There are two programming conceptions here which could help.

**The first one is called** _**constrained programming**_**.**

That basically means to put restrictions after each number placement. One puts a number on the board and that immediately excludes this number from further usage in the current _row, column_ and _sub-box_. That propagates _constraints_ and helps to reduce the number of combinations to consider.

**The second one is called** _**backtracking**_**.**

If we found there's no solution for current situation, we backtrack.

```java
class Solution {
    private final static int SIZE = 9;
    private char[][] board = new char[9][9];

    // validity arrays
    private int[] rows = new int[9];
    private int[] cols = new int[9];
    private int[] boxes = new int[9];

    private boolean solved = false;

    public void solveSudoku(char[][] board) {
        this.board = board;
        initialValidity(board);

        backtrack(0, 0);
    }

    private void initialValidity(char[][] board) {
        for (int row = 0; row < SIZE; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < SIZE; col++) {
                if (board[row][col] != '.') {
                    updateValidity(row, col, board[row][col] - '0');
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private void updateValidity(int row, int col, int num) {
        rows[row] ^= 1 << (num - 1);
        cols[col] ^= 1 << (num - 1);
        boxes[3 * (row / 3) + col / 3] ^= 1 << (num - 1);
    }

    private void backtrack(int row, int col) {
        if (row == SIZE) {
            solved = true;
        } else if (board[row][col] != '.') {
            backtrack(row + (col + 1) / 9, (col + 1) % 9);
        } else {
            int validNums = 0x01ff & ~(rows[row] | cols[col] | boxes[3 * (row / 3) + col / 3]);

            while (validNums != 0) {
                int p = validNums & -validNums;
                int num = (int) (Math.log(p) / Math.log(2)) + 1;
                validNums ^= p;

                board[row][col] = (char) (num + '0');
                updateValidity(row, col, num);

                backtrack(row + (col + 1) / 9, (col + 1) % 9);

                if (solved) {
                    break;
                }

                board[row][col] = '.';
                updateValidity(row, col, num);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis

* **Time complexity:** $$O(1)$$. The number of operations is $$(9!)^9$$. For one row, there're $$9!$$ possibilities.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$.
