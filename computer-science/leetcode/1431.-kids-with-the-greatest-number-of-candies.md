# 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

## Description

Given the array `candies` and the integer `extraCandies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies that the _**ith**_ kid has.

For each kid check if there is a way to distribute `extraCandies` among the kids such that he or she can have the **greatest** number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the **greatest** number of candies.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: 
Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. 
Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies among the kids regardless of who takes the extra candy.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= candies.length <= 100`
* `1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
* `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`

## Approach

Get the `max` of `candies`, then for each elements in `candies` check `candies[i] + extraCandies > max` 

```java
class Solution {
  public static List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
    List<Boolean> res = new ArrayList();
    int max = Arrays.stream(candies).max().getAsInt();

    for (int num_candies : candies) {
      if (num_candies + extraCandies < max) {
        res.add(false);
      } else {
        res.add(true);
      }
    }
    return res;
  }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

* **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$
* **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$ \(Exclude output arraylist\).
