# 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
3. A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

**Example:**  


```text
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```

**Follow up:**  
Could you do better than O\(n2\) per `move()` operation?

## Approach: Array

### Implementation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java" %}
```java
class TicTacToe {
    private int[][] players;
    private int n;
    private boolean isEnd;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        this.n = n;
        players = new int[2][2 * n + 2];
        isEnd = false;
    }

    /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins. */
    public int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        if (isEnd) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (++players[player - 1][row] == n) {
            isEnd = true;
            return player;
        }

        if (++players[player - 1][n + col] == n) {
            isEnd = true;
            return player;
        }

        if (row == col && ++players[player - 1][2 * n] == n) {
            isEnd = true;
            return player;
        }

        if (row + col == n - 1 && ++players[player - 1][2 * n + 1] == n) {
            isEnd = true;
            return player;
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time complexity:** $$O(N)$$.
* **Space complexity:** $$O(N)$$.
