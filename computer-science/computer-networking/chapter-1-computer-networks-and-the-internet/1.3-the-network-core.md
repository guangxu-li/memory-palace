## 1.3.1 Packet Switching

### Store-and-Forward Transmission

![Figure 1.11 Store-and-forward packet switching](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

The end-to-end delay of sending $$P$$ packet from source to detination over a path consisting of $$N$$ links each of rate $$R$$ is: $$\text{dend-to-end}=(N+P)LR$$.

### Queuing Delays and Packet Loss

In addition to the store-and-forward delays, packets may also suffer output buffer **queuing delays**.

Arriving packet may find that the buffer is completely full with other packets waiting for transmission. In this case, **packet loss** will occur 

### Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols

Each router has a **forwarding table** that maps destination addresses \(or portions of the destination addresses\) to that router's outbound links.
