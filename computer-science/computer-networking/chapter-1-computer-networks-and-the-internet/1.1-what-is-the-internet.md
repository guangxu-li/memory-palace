End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches**.

The two most prominent types in today's Internet are **routers** and **link-layer switches**. Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks, while routers are typically used in the network core.

The **Transmission Control Protocol \(TCP\)** and the **Internet Protocol \(IP\)** are two of the most important protocols in the Internet.

## 1.1.2 A Services Description

The applications are said to be **distributed appliations** if they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.

End systems attached to the Internet provide a **socket interface** that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.

## 1.1.3 What Is a Protocol?

All communication activity in internet governed by protocols.

> A **protocol** defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or recript of a message or other event.
